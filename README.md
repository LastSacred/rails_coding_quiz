Requirements

Build a Rails API that responds to the following endpoints:

`GET /tacos` - Returns a list of all tacos in the database
`POST /tacos` - Creates a taco with the given parameters
`DELETE /tacos/:id` - Removes the taco with this ID from the database

The server should work with the provided client page.

NOTE: The HTML file will not work if you load it in your browser as a file (e.g. file://).
