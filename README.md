## What We Look For In A Candidate

  1. Knowledge of Ruby on Rails.
  2. Familiarity with Javascript.
  2. Can work with technologies (i.e. Angular) that you may not have seen before.
  3. Can work independently and troubleshoot issues with **minimal requirements and guidance**.

## Requirements

#### Step 1: Build a Rails API that supports the provided Angular App (see /index.html):

  The API should respond to the following endpoints:

  1. `GET /tacos` - Returns a list of all tacos in the database
  2. `POST /tacos` - Creates a taco with the given parameters
  3. `DELETE /tacos/:id` - Removes the taco with this ID from the database

#### Step 2: Upload your completed solution to a public Github repository so we can review.

#### Step 3: Host the working solution on Heroku and send the Heroku App URL to us for review.

## Completely Optional Bonuses Features: 

  1.  Add RSpec tests for the controller and model.
  2.  Add Validations to the Taco model.
  3.  Add another meat.
  4.  Add another side.
  5.  Add your favorite gem to the project and improve on this application.
